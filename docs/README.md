## Description

The digital catalog project is a Forge-powered responsive web application that enables companies to publish key models (Inventor, Fusion360) from Fusion Team or BIM360 Docs
to their proprietary catalog. Companies can create the catalog structure they need as well as retire products, which have reached end-of-life, from the catalog.

External users can search the catalog and view a 3D representation of each catalog item using the Forge Viewer.

This digital catalog solution also delivers interactive instructions workflow (assembly / disassembly instructions) by supporting animations
authored in Fusion 360 in the Forge Viewer.

This web application can act as a foundation for more advanced workflows, such as digital twin initiatives.

## Build and Test

Because our frontend app (./src/client) is developed separately from our backend (./src/server) - i.e. our backend exposes an
API for our frontend to talk to, then our frontend is essentially a purely static app. We can deploy
the built content in the ```www``` directory to any static file server, but we need to make sure to set the correct
publicPath.

You can review how the frontend app will be built by reading the configuration in the ```./vue.config.js``` file.

To build the frontend app: ```npm run build```

This will create a new directory ```./www``` with the static files.

### Development build

1. Set environment variables

    ```FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth``` \
    ```FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<Your Forge Client ID>``` \
    ```FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your Forge Client Secret>``` \
    ```MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Uri>``` \
    ```NODE_ENV=development``` \
    ```USE_LOAD_BALANCER=false```

2. Start Vue.js front-end app

    ```npm run serve```

3. Start Koa.js back-end app

    ```npm run init```\
    ```npm run dev``` (on mac) \
    ```npm run windev``` (on windows)

If you run into an error connecting to MongoDB, make sure you specify the database name in your connection string.
`mongoose.connect('mongodb://username:password@host:port/database?options...', {useNewUrlParser: true});`

### Test build

1. Set environment variables

    ```FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth``` \
    ```FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<Your Forge Client ID>``` \
    ```FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your Forge Client Secret>``` \
    ```MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Uri>``` \
    ```NODE_ENV=test``` \
    ```USE_LOAD_BALANCER=false```

2. Run the tests

    ```npm run init```\
    ```npm run test``` (on mac) \
    ```npm run wintest``` (on windows)

### Production build

1. Set environment variables

    ```FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=https://<Your Web Server>/api/forge/callback/oauth``` \
    ```FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<Your Forge Client ID>``` \
    ```FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your Forge Client Secret>``` \
    ```MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Uri>``` \
    ```NODE_ENV=production``` \
    ```USE_LOAD_BALANCER=false``` \
    ```VUE_APP_KOA_HOST=<Your Web Server>``` \
    ```VUE_HOST=<Your Web Server>```

2. Build Vue.js front-end app

    ```npm run build```

3. Start Koa.js back-end app

    ```npm run init```\
    ```npm start``` (on mac) \
    ```npm start``` (on windows)

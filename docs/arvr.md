# AR/VR Operation, Maintenance and Training

Most manufacturing companies use various industrial equipments and machines to manufacture their products. There is always a need to look for revenue growth opportunities and improving efficiency and cost to service industrial machines is one way to meet this goal. 

Nowadays, with the technological advances in augmented reality, manufacturers can create instructions for operating, servicing, repairing their machines and those instructions can be played as animations in an AR/VR device. Machine expertise can be shared intuitively in an augmented reality scene and each machine operator can access work instructions from anywhere, as well as getting the expert guidance they need in a rich AR environment.

This digital catalog app has a built-in feature to enable AR workflows by adding translation support for most CAD file formats to the [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) (GL Transmission Format) file format. glTF format is an effective way to streamline authoring workflows and enable interoperable use of 3D content across the industry. Most AR/VR solutions can import glTF files.

## Translate SVF to glTF

The digital catalog app publisher console can be configured to become the translation pipeline of CAD models to SVF and glTF formats. 

To enable this translation feature, simply login to the Administrative console and turn on the feature toggle *AR/VR Toolkit*.

To generate glTF files, simply publish a CAD model to the catalog and once the translation completes, the admin user can download the glTF output via a right-click on the catalog item displayed in the publisher console.

The glTF files can be emailed to the person who will author the animations.
